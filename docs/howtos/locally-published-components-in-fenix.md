# Using locally-published components in Fenix

It's often important to test work-in-progress changes to this repo against a real-world
consumer project. The most reliable method of performing such testing is to publish your
components to a local Maven repository, and adjust the consuming project to install them
from there.

With support from the upstream project, it's possible to do this in a single step using
our auto-publishing workflow.

## Using the auto-publishing workflow

Some consumers (notably [Fenix](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/)) have support for
automatically publishing and including a local development version of application-services
in their build. The workflow is:

1. Check out the consuming project.
1. Edit (or create) the file `local.properties` *in the consuming project* and tell it where to
   find your local checkout of application-services, by adding a line like:

   `autoPublish.application-services.dir=path/to/your/checkout/of/application-services`

1. Optionally, speed up your build by editing (or creating) the file `local.properties` *in
   application-services* and instructing it to only build for certain target platforms:

   ```
   # You'll typically want "x86" when testing on an emulator,
   # and either "arm" or "arm64" when testing on a physical device.
   rust.targets=x86
   ```

1. Build the consuming project following its usual build procedure, e.g. via `./gradlew assembleDebug` or `./gradlew
   test`.

## Using a manual workflow

Note: This is a bit tedious, and you should first try the auto-publishing workflow described
above. But if the auto-publishing workflow bitrots then it's important to know how to do it
by hand.

1. Inside the `application-services` repository root:
    1. In [`.buildconfig-android.yml`](app-services-yaml), change
       `libraryVersion` to end in `-TESTING$N` <sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>,
       where `$N` is some number that you haven't used for this before.

       Example: `libraryVersion: 0.27.0-TESTING3`
    2. Check your `local.properties` file, and add `rust.targets=x86` if you're
       testing on the emulator, `rust.targets=arm` if you're testing on 32-bit
       arm (arm64 for 64-bit arm, etc). This will make the build that's done in
       the next step much faster.
    3. Run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`. This may take between 5 and 10 minutes.

2. Inside the `android-components` repository root:
    1. In [`.buildconfig.yml`](android-components-yaml), change
       `componentsVersion` to end in `-TESTING$N` <sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>,
       where `$N` is some number that you haven't used for this before.

       Example: `componentsVersion: 0.51.0-TESTING3`
    2. Inside [`buildSrc/src/main/java/Dependencies.kt`](android-components-deps),
       change `mozilla_appservices` to reference the `libraryVersion` you
       published in step 2 part 1.

       Example: `const val mozilla_appservices = "0.27.0-TESTING3"`

    3. Inside [`build.gradle`](android-components-build-gradle), add
       `mavenLocal()` inside `allprojects { repositories { <here> } }`.

    4. Inside the android-component's `local.properties` file, ensure
       `substitutions.application-services.dir` is *NOT* set.

    5. Run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`.

3. Inside the consuming project repository root:
    1. Inside [`build.gradle`](fenix-build-gradle-1), add
       `mavenLocal()` inside `allprojects { repositories { <here> } }`.
        1. If you added a new project to the megazord (e.g. you went through the
           parts of step 1) you must also add `mavenLocal()` to
           [`buildscript { ... dependencies { <here> }}`](fenix-build-gradle-2)

    2. Ensure that `local.properties` does not contain any configuration to
       related to auto-publishing the application-services repo.

    3. Inside [`buildSrc/src/main/java/Dependencies.kt`](fenix-deps), change the
       version numbers for android-components and/or application-services to
       match the new versions you defined above.

       Example: `const val mozilla_android_components = "0.51.0-TESTING3"`

       Example: `const val mozilla_appservices = "0.27.0-TESTING3"`

You should now be able to build and run the consuming application (assuming you could before all
this).

### Caveats

1. This assumes you have followed the [android/rust build setup](./setup-android-build-environment.md)
2. Make sure you're fully up to date in all repos, unless you know you need to
   not be.
3. This omits the steps if changes needed because, e.g. application-services
   made a breaking change to an API used in android-components. These should be
   understandable to fix, you usually should be able to find a PR with the fixes
   somewhere in the android-component's list of pending PRs (or, failing that, a
   description of what to do in the application-services changelog).
4. Ask in #sync if you get stuck.


## Adding support for the auto-publish workflow

If you had to use the manual workflow above and found it incredibly tedious, you might like to
try adding support for the auto-publish workflow to the consuming project. The details will differ
depending on the specifics of the project's build setup, but at a high level you will need to:

1. Locate (or add) the code for parsing the `local.properties` file, and add support for loading
   a directory path from the property `autoPublish.application-services.dir`.  This is typically done in
   [settings.gradle](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/blob/0d398f7d44f877a61cd243ee9fac587a9d5c0a1f/settings.gradle#L31).
   The path should be relative to the root directory of your project.
1. When the key `autoPublish.application-services.dir` is present in `local.properties`, have your
   build script do two things:
   1. Spawn a subprocess to run this command in the specified directory:

      `./gradlew autoPublishForLocalDevelopment

      This ensures that your local changes to application-servivces will be packaged and published
      to a local maven repo for consumption.

   1. Apply the build script from `./build-scripts/substitute-local-appservices.gradle` in the referenced
      directory.  This ensures that the project is configured to find and load the locally-published components
      build by the step above.

      For a single-project build this would look something like:

      `apply from "${appServicesSrcDir}/build-scripts/substitute-local-appservices.gradle"`

      For a multi-project build it should be applied to all subprojects, like:

      ```
      subprojects {
          apply from "${appServicesSrcDir}/build-scripts/substitute-local-appservices.gradle"`
      }
      ```

<b id="note1">[1]</b>: It doesn't have to start with `-TESTING`, it only needs
to have the format `-someidentifier`. `-SNAPSHOT$N` is also very common to use,
however without the numeric suffix, this has specific meaning to gradle, so we
avoid it.  Additionally, while the `$N` we have used in our running example has
matched (e.g. all of the identifiers ended in `-TESTING3`, this is not required,
so long as you match everything up correctly at the end. This can be tricky, so
I always try to use the same number).
